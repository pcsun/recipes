    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Nicknamed “candy chicken,” Korean fried chicken is known for its
      addictively crunchy exterior and its thick sweet-and-spicy sauce.
      Increasingly popularized in recent years, Korean fried chicken was born
      around the time of the Korean War: American soldiers stationed in South
      Korea brought with them a culinary soft spot for deep-fried chicken.
      Recipes evolved through the following decades and boomed during the 1997
      Asian financial crisis, when high unemployment rates led many jobless
      workers to create their own fried chicken joints to make a living.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp. baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp. garlic powder</li>
      <li>2 lb. chicken wings</li>
      <li>1 tbsp. freshly grated ginger</li>
      <li>1/2 c. cornstarch</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make wings: In a deep pot over medium-high heat, heat 4 to 6 cups
        vegetable oil to 275°. Line a large plate or baking sheet with paper
        towels. In a small bowl, combine salt, pepper, baking powder, and garlic
        powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pat wings dry with paper towels, then rub with grated ginger and season
        with salt mixture. In a large bowl, toss wings with cornstarch and
        squeeze to compress coating onto each wing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully add wings to oil and fry until skin is just lightly crisped
        and golden, occasionally flipping with tongs, about 15 to 18 minutes.
        Remove wings from oil and set aside on prepared plate. Let rest briefly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat frying oil to 400°. Return wings to pot and fry again until deeply
        golden and skin is crisp and crunchy, about 7 to 8 minutes. Remove wings
        from oil and place in a large mixing bowl.
      </li>
    </ol>
