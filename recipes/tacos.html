    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Traditional Mexican beef tacos are made with marinated sliced or shredded
      beef on soft corn tortillas. Those are great! But, thatâ€™s not what most
      Americans think of when we think of classic tacos.
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb. 90% to 93% lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1 Tablespoon chili powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 cup water</li>
      <li>12 taco shells</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add the beef to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Break the meat
        apart with a wooden spoon. Add the chili powder, cumin, salt, oregano,
        garlic powder, and pepper to the meat. Stir well. Cook until the meat is
        cooked through, about 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to medium. Add the tomato sauce and water. Stir to
        combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 7-8 minutes, until some of the
        liquid evaporates but the meat mixture is still a little saucy. Remove
        from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>Warm the taco shells according to their package directions.</li>
      <li>
        Fill the taco shells with 2 heaping tablespoons of taco meat. Top with
        desired taco toppings: shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, chopped
        tomatoes, diced red onion, taco sauce, sour cream, guacamole, etc.
      </li>
    </ol>
